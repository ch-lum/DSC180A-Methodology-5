## Questions
**What is the most interesting topic covered in your domain this quarter?**
The most interesting topic covered in the domain so far has been learning about all the different mechanisms and how they are used to guarantee privacy. A lot of the mechanisms seem like puzzles, figuring out creative ways to add noise or obfuscate information as to guarantee privacy. For example, the exponential mechanism only releases a maximum. A binary tree mechanism can release partial sums of the data but does so in a way that only realeases $n\log n$ times. It's pretty interesting.

**Describe a potential investigation you would like to pursue for your Quarter 2 Project.**
One potential investigation for our Quarter 2 Project is finding new ways to release certain statistics about datasets. There exist some simple data analytics tasks that aren't privatized because differential privacy is still pretty novel. Our mentor will give us a list of these analysis tasks later.

**What is a potential change you’d make to the approach taken in your current Quarter 1 Project**
A potential change that I would make in our approach to our current Quarter 1 Project would be that we would've used the Intel telemetry dataset to start with, instead of finding another telemetry dataset. This is because this will be the dataset we'll be using next quarter, adn I think it would've been good if we could have gotten familiar with the dataset before next quarter started.

**What other techniques would you be interested in using in your project?**
I think that differentially private machine learning looks interesting. It seems like it would take a lot of work to figure out and get to using, but if possible I would like to use DP machine learning. Proving differential privacy guarantees for DP machine learning sounds awful though, so I'm not so sure that I think I'm actually missing out on much.
